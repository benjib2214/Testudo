One of the most stressful parts of the semester for undergraduate students at most universities is the process of registering for classes. The uncertainties of not knowing whether or not you can get the schedule that you want can be very nerve-wracking and can add unnecessary stress on an already overstressed student. This project should help students better prepare for their registration.

This is a web scraper for the University of Maryland Schedule of Classes that gathers information about course professor, section, and available seats relative to total number of seats. While there are several applications that can check how many seats are available in a certain class at any given point in time, the data about the rate at which seats are taken is not stored from semester to semester. The web scraper stores the data on a daily basis and is ultimately able to plot as a function of time, the number of available seats in a certain section of a class. ![alt text](https://github.com/benjib2214/Testudo/blob/master/Figure_1.png)

In the future, the web scraper should be able to make extrapolations and be able to predict whether or not a certain class will be full by a certain date.
